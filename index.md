# linux-chenxing

## Intro

This is intended to be a repository for info on the MStar/[SigmaStar](http://www.sigmastarsemi.com) SoCs
and the associated mainling effort.

This will probably never get as big as linux-sunxi so github pages should be
more than enough.

Before MStar was bought out by MediaTek the company offered a wide range
of SoCs focused at STB and camera applications. Since the company was
bought by MediaTek the camera SoC part of the company has been spun out
into the fully owned subsidiary called Sigmastar. The camera SoCs that are 
now marketed by Sigmastar will be the main focus here.

It's worth noting that the MStar/Sigmastar camera SoCs seem to be derived
from the SoCs made by Alpha Imaging Technology which was merged into MStar
at some point.

## FAQ

- Q: Why linux-chenxing?
- A: The name is a parody of linux-sunxi for Allwinner SoCs. MStar in Chinese is
     chenxing and the newer SigmaStar name is xingchen.

- Q: Is this the official support site for MStar/SigmaStar?
- A: No. There is no relationship between this site and the vendor. This is a
     "community" (community meaning one fat guy with a multimeter right now) research
     effort.
     
- Q: Have you reached out to the vendor to get more information?
- A: Yes, they said without an NDA and project in place they cannot help.
     Signing an NDA would be a bad idea for code that is going mainline.

- Q: If I pay you money will you support me using the official SDKs?
- A: No.

- Q: Is there an IRC channel, discord or something for discussion?
- A: Please use github's [dicussion feature](https://github.com/linux-chenxing/linux-chenxing.org/discussions) for now.

- Q: Should I upload SDKs and post links here?
- A: Please don't. Extract the parts that are licensed in a friendly way
    (i.e. GPLv2 or BSD) and push them onto github or somewhere and link that instead.
    
    The exception to this rule is where the SDK has already been leaked to github.
    For example there are some copies of the SDKs that seem to have been uploaded by
    manufacturers that are actually trying to comply with the licenses covering the kernel, u-boot etc
    and uploaded the entire SDK.

    Basically, if someone else leaks their copy of an SDK that's their problem.

- Q: Should I upload datasheets or other references here?
- A: Maybe. If they are already easy to download then putting them here for non-profit educational/research
     purposes should be ok. IANAL but as far as I can tell github is in the US and
     [fair use](https://www.copyright.gov/title17/92chap1.html#107) applies.

     Materials that are behind an NDA wall like those in the SDKs might be interesting but
     most of the information they contain can be worked out from the kernel sources or about
     stuff contained the proprietary modules we don't really care about anyways.

- Q: Why is Tux orange and why does he have a stalk and leaf sticking out of his head?
- A: The SigmaStar logo is an orange isn't it? Looks like one to me.

# Porting Progress Matrix

## u-boot

For most chips u-boot is loaded by loading the SPL as IPL-CUST from the IPL so that blob is needed.
The mercury5 however can boot with the u-boot SPL as the IPL so no blobs are required.
Getting the other chips to boot without the vendor IPL is mostly a case of doing the DDR setup in the SPL.

|                           | load u-boot SPL from boot ROM | load u-boot SPL from vendor IPL | load u-boot from SPI NOR | load u-boot from SPI NAND | load u-boot from SD |

# Data Mining Progress

This table is an attempt to collect all of the different part numbers for
the different families and the resources that have been found to reverse engineer each of them.

If possible the data codes will have the earliest and latest known date codes so that we can tell roughly
when each type of chip was produced.

# Mainlining progress

See [mainlining](mainlining.md)

# SoCs

Spotted a chip that isn't here? Please see [adding new chips](addingnewchips.md).

## MIPS based

MStar used to make a lot of MIPS based SoCs for STBs. These aren't that
interesting in themselves but the IP blocks used in the MIPS SoCs were
carried forward to the later ARM chips so any datasheets that can be found
for the MIPS SoCs might help with reverse engineering the current ARM based
ones.

To get the device tree out of the kernel you can use binwalk + [extract-dtb](https://github.com/PabloCastellano/extract-dtb.git) and dtc.

```
binwalk -e <firmware.bin>
extract-dtb.py <extracted firmware dir><uncompressed kernel blob>
dtc -I dtb -O dts -o out.dts <extracted dtb that looks right>
```
